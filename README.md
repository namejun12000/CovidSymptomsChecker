# Covid Symptoms Checker

The goal of this project is to create a model for determining infection based on COVID-19 symptoms. By comparing the accuracy of the three classification models, decision tree, support vector machine, and logistic regression analysis, it is possible to find the optimal model and identify the most influential symptoms when infected with COVID-19.
